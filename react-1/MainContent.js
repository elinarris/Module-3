        Hey, I am a 29 year old student dev at V-School! I love outdoors,
        thrifting, and doing DIY's around the house. I have a license in
        Cosmetology, but I also cocktail on the side, as well as Program! Thank
        you for reading a little about me!
      </p>
      <p>P.S. Below is a list of places I would love to explore.</p>
